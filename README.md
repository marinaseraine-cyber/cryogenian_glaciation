## Conjugate Partitioned Recursion (CPR) 
Change point models are statistical methods used to detect changes in the pattern of a dataset over time (Hawkins et al. 2003). In this study, we applied Conjugate Partitioned Recursion (CPR) was applied to investigate potential shifts in the distribution of ÔÅ§18O through time, focused on the interval from 500 Ma to 900 Ma (Fig. 2). The CPR algorithm investigates for a location to divide the data with different means (Jensen, 2013; Spencer et al., 2022). For this study, we have applied one degree of freedom in this model. The degrees of freedom are defined as a function of a sample size and independent variables (Pandey and Bright, 2008).
